; Common functions shared across all parts of this project.
;
; In order to know when a function starts, I'll put mov x18, x18 right
; before it. When hookgen.pl sees it, it'll write its file offset to a
; "function starts" array in common_instrs.h. In svc_stalker.c, I'll use that
; function starts array to calculate the virtual address of each of these
; functions to store in the stalker cache. The order of these functions
; in this file cannot change. If a new one is to be added, I need to put
; it at the end.
