; This will back up the original stack frame, call handle_svc_hook, and set LR
; to return_interceptor if the current exception is ESR_EC_SVC_64.
;
; We've come from sleh_synchronous, it has three arguments, second being ESR_EL1.
; (because of that we can clobber x3, x4, x5, x6, and x7)
;
; !!! Be very careful when adding code before b.ne done. If you cause a crash
; then, the kernel will call sleh_synchronous, which will call this code,
; then you'll crash and the kernel will call sleh_synchronous, which will call
; this code, and on and on until the stack is corrupted.
